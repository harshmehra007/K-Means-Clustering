This project demonstrates the implementation of the K-Means Clustering algorithm, an unsupervised learning technique used to group data points into clusters based on similarity. The goal of this project is to explore clustering techniques, visualize results, and understand their applications in real-world scenarios such as customer segmentation, pattern recognition, and market analysis.
